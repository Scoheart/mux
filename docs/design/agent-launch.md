# Agent launcher

The Agent picker and pinned-icon primary click continue to navigate MUX configuration. A compact split action in Agent details launches the runtime; pinned icons expose the same action in a context menu.

Agent details use one unframed workspace directly on the page, without an outer
background block, border or rounded shell. The icon sits above the centered name; credential,
edit and launch controls sit at the upper right. A single resource tab bar shares
one row with bulk actions, configuration and add controls. The current tab's paths
and documentation expand inline through the configuration button. Displayed home
paths use `~` while the opener receives the original target.

Resources use three columns, reducing to two on narrower desktop windows. MCPs
use short rows with name/transport beside the icon and fixed-width controls on
the right. Skills and Models separate the description from the footer; footer
controls occupy a nonshrinking grid column, so long text and shared-state badges
cannot push switches outside the card. External items retain their read-only and
convergence contracts. Model selection caveats remain visible. Preserve MUX's
existing palette: blue actions and selection, green enabled switches, and the
original semantic warning colors. The primary launch action is labeled briefly; missing runtimes offer
installation, and icon-only actions retain tooltips and accessible names.

Consumption panels render their existing controls into a shared toolbar slot,
keeping the same handlers and disabling conditions. The configuration section and
the resource list follow the same tab state. Changing Agent resets the open
configuration panel; changing resource tab updates its contents in place.

The configuration editor embeds the same controlled launch fields used by the
pinned-icon launcher. Launch-only edits call the existing launch-preference API.
Combined edits first review/commit capability paths, then persist launch settings.
No launch preference is written before review confirmation. If path commit
succeeds but launch save fails, the editor records the new path baseline, retains
the launch draft and reports the partial result; retry only saves the pending
launch settings. Configurable Agents expose launch settings through this editor
only; the workspace run menu keeps the CLI directory action. Installation docs are
a separate toolbar button before the credential selector. Desktop launchers with
no remaining run actions omit the dropdown arrow.

- Desktop / IDE: resolve an actual installed application and use the OS launcher, activating an existing instance.
- CLI: resolve an executable, select a working directory on first use, and launch in macOS Terminal. Remember the per-Agent directory after successful dispatch; allow choosing another directory.
- Web: open the runtime website, not its documentation.
- Missing runtime: offer the existing official installation link. No automatic installation.
- Unmapped / custom Agent: configure an app path, executable plus separate arguments, or HTTP(S) URL. Saving these preferences never launches a process.

Core owns the built-in launch catalog, executable/application discovery, validation, persisted preferences and launch orchestration. Tauri commands run blocking work off the UI thread. The UI uses a shared launcher provider for detail and context-menu actions. Launch state does not mutate MCPs, Models, Skills or credentials.

Use exact process arguments for app/URL dispatch. CLI shell and AppleScript strings are encoded separately; commands, paths and arguments are treated as data. Never run discovery commands or install packages. Terminal actions happen only on a user click.

The macOS bundle declares the Apple Events automation entitlement and a Terminal usage description. On first CLI launch, macOS may ask the user to allow MUX to control Terminal. A successful dispatch confirms that the launch request was sent, not that the Agent has authenticated or initialized successfully.

This iteration targets the shipped macOS desktop. Unsupported hosts report that explicitly. CLI entry points without verified metadata remain configurable rather than guessed. Existing installation probes supply declared command candidates; explicit data overrides distinguish IDE/desktop products and extension hosts.

Validation: user requested no test suites, formatters or preflight. Inspect the diff and compile the desktop for local delivery; do not launch third-party Agents as a test. No publication without a new release request and lane selection.
