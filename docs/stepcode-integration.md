# Step Code integration

Verified on 2026-09-23 against the official Step Code documentation. No user configuration, credentials, or session files were read or changed.

| MUX Agent | Command | User MCP file | User Skills directory |
|---|---|---|---|
| `step-code` | `~/.stepcode/bin/step` | `~/.stepcode/config.toml` (`[mcp_servers]`) | `~/.stepcode/agent/skills` |

Step Code also reads `~/.agents/skills`. MUX records that directory as a compatibility alias. Project `.stepcode/config.toml` is not a write target.

## Verified contracts

- Official [MCP](https://platform.stepfun.com/docs/zh/step-code/customization/mcp) declares stdio with `command` / `args` / `env` and Streamable HTTP with `url`. Legacy SSE is not a supported substitute. HTTP headers use `http_headers`. Bearer env vars, OAuth tables, tool filters, and timeouts stay outside the fields MUX rewrites.
- `enabled = false` keeps a server out of Step Code's active list. MUX refuses to update that entry instead of presenting it as effective.
- Official [Skills](https://platform.stepfun.com/docs/zh/step-code/customization/skills) use `SKILL.md` packages in `~/.stepcode/agent/skills`.
- Official [models](https://platform.stepfun.com/docs/zh/step-code/configuration/models) and [data paths](https://platform.stepfun.com/docs/zh/step-code/configuration/data-paths) put credentials in `auth.json` and custom providers in `models.json`. MUX does not write either file.
- The installer places the binary at `~/.stepcode/bin/step`. MUX launches that path and does not probe a bare `step` command, because other products use the same name.
