# Supported agents

MUX's agent data comes in two layers:

- **Configurable targets**: 39 individually verified product definitions, 37 of which have a stable user-level global config file that MUX can safely read and write.
- **Client directory**: sourced from public MCP client directories and the official client matrix, used for discovery only. After deduplication against the configurable targets, the UI can search **191** clients in total.

Clients whose global file path, top-level key, and entry structure have not been confirmed are shown for discovery only and cannot be written to. This keeps expanding coverage without writing a generic JSON guess into an unknown product's config.

### Targets that need special distinction

- **Pi**: Pi's core does not include MCP. MUX's definition applies only to environments with the community `pi-mcp-adapter` installed, so the UI clearly labels it a community extension.
- **Devin / QoderWork**: the products support MCP, but no stable user-level global file contract was verified, so they can only be viewed for discovery and not written to.
- **Claude Desktop / BoltAI**: the local files listed natively support stdio only. Remote MCP is managed by Claude Connectors or BoltAI's `mcp-remote` approach, respectively.
- **Goose**: the generic docs example uses `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`, but the current macOS source actually uses `~/Library/Application Support/Block/goose/config/config.yaml`; MUX locates it by the runtime code.

## Format differences across agents

MUX does not treat every client as the same `mcpServers` JSON:

- OpenCode / Kilo use `type: local|remote`, with a local `command` as an array.
- Codex uses TOML tables and `http_headers`; Mistral Vibe uses a `[[mcp_servers]]` TOML list.
- Continue uses a YAML list and requires root-level `name`, `version`, and `schema`; Goose and Hermes also use their own YAML maps.
- Gemini / Qwen use `httpUrl`; Windsurf and Antigravity use `serverUrl`.
- Cline puts connection fields in a `transport` sub-object; Tabnine puts HTTP headers in `requestInit.headers`.
- Rovo, Amazon Q, Augment, OpenHands, etc. require an explicit transport type; Kimi / Hermes only write `transport: sse` for legacy SSE.

Each built-in target has its own codec. On upgrade, MUX updates the official schema metadata but preserves your choices for enabled state and global path.

## Safe-write boundary

MUX parses agent files locally, but only provides the structured connection fields of the target MCP entry to the UI. The complete config file never enters the UI, logs, source cache, or the network, and MUX never overwrites your config by "deserializing the whole file and rewriting it."

- JSON / JSONC use a syntax tree to locate the target entry, preserving comments, indentation, key order, other servers, and other top-level settings.
- Both TOML maps and TOML lists are edited locally; YAML maps / lists likewise preserve unmanaged content and comments.
- Agent-private fields like `enabled`, OAuth, timeouts, tool allowlists, and approval policies are preserved as-is.
- Writes are refused on an invalid document, a wrong node type, duplicate target keys, a YAML multi-document file, a failed backup, or a concurrent modification.
- A timestamped independent backup is created before writing (directory `0700`, file `0600` on Unix), and the final replacement is atomic via a temp file in the same directory; symlink targets and the original config file's permissions are left unchanged.

MUX currently manages only user-level global config and does not offer project-level writes.

## Custom agents

Click `+` next to the desktop app's agent selector, or press `n` in the TUI's Agents screen, to add a custom JSON, TOML, or YAML global target. Custom targets use the standard map layout; only verified built-in targets enable product-specific field conversion. Built-in targets allow only overriding the path, to avoid accidentally turning an official schema into an incompatible format.
